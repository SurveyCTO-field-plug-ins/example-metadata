![A text field using this plug-in](extras/feature-demo-metadata.jpg)

## Description

This field plug-in is meant to demonstrate how to use field metadata. It adds a second input box below the regular text input, which will store metadata. This value is stored separately from the field's response. Learn more about field metadata in the [API reference documentation](https://github.com/surveycto/field-plug-in-resources/blob/master/docs/api-reference.md).

*Note: this is not intended to be used to collect actual data. It is intended for demonstration/testing purposes.*
