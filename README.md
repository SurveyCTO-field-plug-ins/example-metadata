# example-metadata

## Description

This field plug-in is meant to demonstrate how to use field metadata. Use it on a text field to add a second input box below the regular text input. The second box will store metadata, which is stored separately from the field's response. Metadata will not be included when the form is finalized and submitted, so it will not appear in the final form dataset.

*Note: this is not intended to be used to collect actual data. It is intended for demonstration/testing purposes.*

## How to use

1. Download the test form [extras/test-form](extras/test-form) from this repo and upload it to your SurveyCTO server.
1. Download the [example-metadata.fieldplugin.zip](example-metadata.fieldplugin.zip) file from this repo, and attach it to the test form on your SurveyCTO server.
