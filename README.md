![A text field using this plug-in](extras/feature-demo-metadata.jpg)

## Description

This field plug-in is meant to demonstrate how to use field metadata. It adds a second input box below the regular text input, which will store metadata. This value is stored separately from the field's response. From the [developer documentation](https://github.com/surveycto/field-plug-in-resources/blob/master/docs/developer-docs-home.md#how-can-a-field-plug-in-interact-with-a-form) for field plug-ins:

> Your field plug-in can store metadata alongside response data. This metadata can be accessed by other fields in the form using the `plug-in-metadata(field)` function. This can be used to pass information from your field plug-in to other parts of the form.

Try using the example form to see how field metadata can be used. Learn more about field metadata in the [API reference documentation](https://github.com/surveycto/field-plug-in-resources/blob/master/docs/api-reference.md).

*Note: this field plug-in is not intended to be used to collect actual data. It is intended for demonstration/testing purposes.*
